## Features

- Image classification for traffic management at various locations.
- Utilizes AWS microservices for scalability and flexibility.
- Training jobs for fine-tuning the model to the specific needs of Scones Unlimited.
- Automated workflows using Step Functions for seamless execution.
- Model monitoring to ensure high performance and timely retraining.

## Installation

Please ensure you have the following prerequisites before setting up the project:

- AWS account with appropriate permissions to access SageMaker, Lambda, and Step Functions.
- Python 3.x and pip installed on your local machine.
- Git installed for version control.

The Scones Unlimited Machine Learning Workflow consists of several key stages, each with its own set of functionalities. Below is an overview of the major steps involved:

Data Preparation
Prepare your image dataset for model training. Organize the images into appropriate folders and ensure proper labeling for each category.

Model Training
Use SageMaker to train the image classification model with your prepared dataset. Fine-tune the model as needed to achieve optimal results for Scones Unlimited's specific requirements.

Model Deployment
Once the model is trained and tested, deploy it using AWS Lambda. This will allow real-time inference on new images and provide predictions for traffic management decisions.

Model Monitoring
Implement model monitoring to track the model's performance over time. Set up alerts to trigger retraining if the model's accuracy drops below a predefined threshold.
